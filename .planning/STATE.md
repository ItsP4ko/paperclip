## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Unified task model — reuse issues table for both human and AI tasks; no new entity
- [Init]: Dashboard dedicated + filter in Issues — best of both worlds for human workers
- [Init]: MVP without notifications — user checks tasks proactively via web app

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: InviteLanding.tsx human join end-to-end not fully traced — start Phase 1 with a manual test of the invite flow before building owner UI
- [Phase 1]: Verify `tasks:assign` is auto-granted to owners at join time in accessService
- [Phase 2]: Confirm `principalType: "board"` vs `"user"` distinction before building human permission gate
